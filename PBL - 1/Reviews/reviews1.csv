review
"We hired a car to take us around to see the sights. What lovely places you’ll see. Some areas are cleaner than others. Amazing homes. Glorious daily walks up and down the Marine Drivr to stay fit after several dinners in South Mumbai. In the same time you join the Mumbai people relaxing, doing fitness, eating, drinking etc. A vivid experience."
"It’s always a pleasure to walk along Marine Drive in Mumbai. The Locals and Tourist are found walking and jogging along Marine Drive. The Queens Necklace is a great view but with the pollution can be bothersome at times. It’s advisable to stroll along Marine Drive when one visits Mumbai."
"I was there during the day, and was not too crowed. Clean place. Relaxing. I didn’t see the lights at night but I bet it’s beautiful."
"The Marine Drive is a fantastic place to roam around with fresh atmosphere and a beautiful environment."
"This is the most beautiful place in Mumbai. It is crowded every day of the week. It is visited by almost all the visitors to Mumbai. There won't be a person who did not visit Marine Drive who has come to Mumbai for any work. This place appears to be like Diamond Necklace at night. You experience the vagaries of nature in Monsoon here. In monsoon, we get a spectacular view of Ganapati Visarjan throughout the day and night on Ananat Chaturdashi day. Married as well as new unmarried couples visit this place and enjoy the beautiful sea here. Friends and groups of people flock to this place every day as well as night."
"I absolutely loved this place! I love to have a glimpse of water! Just went by here and manage to experience it for a few minutes! But I´m definitely coming back here with my spouse to spend time here! Got to see many young couples here, catching a breeze... Really place place!"
"Such a beautiful place it is! You will surely have a great time here with your loved ones , not only loved ones but also alone , its so beautifully structured!! its our fav place to spend the evenings!!"
"Nice quiet walk and we were relatively left alone, I was expecting people would try and sell us things but it didn’t happen once. Very busy but worth a walk down while you’re here. Took about half an hour start to finish."
"Stayed at the Oberoi Mumbai. Loved the view from our suite Loved the vibe of the area. Our driver enlightened us as to the beauty and use of the area around the drive"
"Walk along the sea front is a nice way to spend a weekend morning. Evenings brings everyone out to enjoy the seaside. Good place to just walk and enjoy. Spend a few moments or all day here, it's up to you."
"If you are in Mumbai with your friends and feel like chilling, there is no better place than Marine Drive. Marine Drive is a great place in Mumbai. You will not forget the beautiful moments spent here."
"My family loves visiting this place during rainy season. It has the best view during rains. The place is so crowded on 31st of December. Must visit during winters in the morning. So cold and chilling."
"It's always Serene to sit or have a walk by the tracks to enjoy fresh breeze and the calmness of Arabian Sea."
"Another must visit place... The shape is like a necklace... u may visit this place day and/or night as both are just giving a one beautiful necklace’s curve of bay view of Mumbai’s skyline. One best observation location is the the Trident hotel..."
"If in Mumbai, this is a place to visit in the evening as the sun sets. As darkness steps n lights switched on, one can hava a view of the Queens Neckless, its a beautiful view so natural n georgous."
"A MUST visit location in Mumbai. I went there, early AM (8:00) and again, after 7:00 PM. The place was bustling at night. A good vibe and great views. In the AM, there were less numbers of people, but many were exercising and walking to keep fit."
"Good to have a 4 km walk from one end to other. Shaped as necklace looks great at night with the lights on. Cool sea breeze and ofcourse Girgaum Chowpatty to enjoy the beach and Mumbai Street food."
"The place is good for walking but season matters a lot.it is neat clean but very busy in evening.You need to be very familiar to croud and careful about young kids as if you sit on the wall it is dangerous for kids"
"Beautiful 3 kms stretch.. with a fantastic view of the Worli, Malabar hill, Nariman point skyline on one side and gushing water on the other. Be it morning, day time or night.. the entire stretch is very lively.. Also important to state that the administration and the visitors both are doing their bit to keep the drive clean."
"Marine drive always brings me back history of the 60’s it was a time where it was the it place it’s good to go back and re connect that nice time you had"
"This is a lovely pedestrianised path to walk along the coast. It provides great views of Mumbai sky scrapers as well as the sunset. There are points marked in the concrete to show the distances. This area is known as the Queen's Necklace as when viewed from an elevated point it resembles pearls in a necklace."
"I think this place is over hyped in the tourist itinerary. Nothing to do.Lots of couples sitting there."
"Marine Drive is a coastal road, which was constructed after land reclaimed by the Back Bay Reclaimation Company. It was built with the excavated earth of the Ballard Estate in Bombay. A Tourist Attraction offering the view of the Arabian Sea! People come here for Morning Walk/Jog/Run, it’s even more fun to cycle. •Nearest Railway Station - Marine Lines • Uber Stop - Marine Drive • Nearest Hotel - Trident, Marine Drive •Stadium - Wankhede Stadium"
"It's awesome to spend time near the Arabian Sea. Being with friends during late evening is really worth spending time!!"
"This place is really nice, clean and peaceful. You can go alone to enjoy the cold fresh air, with your partner if you want to be in a romantic place or with your friends for having good quality fun. Amazing place."
