Imagica Is like a first copy of all the amusement parks there are outside India.  Like universal studio singapore or ferrari world dubai or Disneyland etc.  Just the food here sucks big time.  The rides are fantastic and it's a perfect getaway for the weekend

"One of the greatest theme park in India. Must visit if you love adrenaline rush, rides and chaos . It's a complete family place for each age group of ppl, need to be selective on ride. Very planned and clean theme park. With lot of food options . You are always engaged can spend 5-7 hours in blink of eye.
Must visit"
Best place if you are searching for theme park it's best but food inside the theme park is costlier than outside the park
I went on a weekday expecting less crowd but still.. Too many people 😂. Nice and fun place. Just be sure you have to plan your trip or you will miss out on amazing experiences. …

Very nice experience of the Lochness ride for my son. The rides are safe and enjoyable and staff is warm and supportive.
"Imagicaa rides are fun and one can have a good day for entertainment. I feel it gets overcrowded and the theme park is not able to handle that much of croud. One star less for the same. Otherwise, it's fun. Food and drinks options are less inside + it's bit expensive too."
On website there is always a 20% discount for any dates but when you do counter booking you have to pay full price. They have very cleverly hidden the fact that you would need to pay full price on their website. Due to this we have to pay …

The water park is huge and it's fun!! Please plan and book your tickets online for discounts. There is no discount offered at the counter. The waiting for each ride is slightly longer but managed well. So i couldn't enjoy all the rides. …
It's an amazing theme park but something is like the food is so expensive in the park even the water bottle is 70 rupees per head isn't it to expensive but the rides are awesome and all thing is amazing. I recommend you to try more things like snow parks and aqua parks it will give awesome experience
"The theme park located at Khopoli serves the purpose. The journey itself is so refreshing and being away from the city, makes it more refreshing. It's a perfect place to spend your precious 12 hours of the day. It has something for everyone …"
You can easily spend entire day with friends and family. The only thing is this place is always over crowded so better you take express ticket and it's worth as you will skip the huge queue for main water rides. Bet to visit during week days avoid on weekends.
We visited a Bollywood theme park and snow park only costs 471/- around  . We have taken a package of 1045( snow park+ Bollywood theme+ wonders of the world) . However There are only 5 wonders. I would suggest to go with friends don't go in …
One of the best theme parks with amazingly amazing rides 🙈🙈 Everything was awesome and the food was tasty. They also take candid pictures of you while u are on the ride but The only issue I faced was that we cannot get 2 or 3 pictures if we …
Too much of wait time lot of rush could have enjoyed if number of people are limited. I feel money wasted as I could not enjoy even half of the park due to long waiting time for rides. Management should limit the number of people so …

To avoid extra expanse at park. …"
They loot you from every nook and corner. Nylon 3rd class dress is upward of 900 rs at aqua Imagica. Better bring your own nylon dress from home. Locker charges 200. food is average but costly. Group of friends or family must buy 1+1 offer …

"Amazing n Exciting theme based park. One will enjoy on hell loads of rides. Try to take all the rides and shows. Be there by 11am-12pm to enjoy the park, it takes around 4-5hrs to coverup all the amazing rides and shows. One should definitely visit with family. Rides for children to elderly persons."
One of the best amusement parks period. Queues are usually long for every ride so be prepared to wait atleast 20mins for every ride. But the wait is totally worth it. Go for express tickets if you aren't patient enough to wait for every ride.
Amazing place. A must visit. Theme park was really nice. It's more then just rides. It's an experience. There were different kinds of experience. The rides aren't much scary because the time is too short for the rides but then again you can …

Very fun place to hang out for a day. Lots of rides to enjoy. Remember to buy express tickets while booking. They cost more but it's better than waiting for 2 hours for a ride. In regular tickets you will be able to cover only 5-6 rides because for the most of the time you will be standing in queues.
Scream machine and ride was interesting. Even the splash ahoy was awesome
