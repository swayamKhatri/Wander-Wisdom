"Trayambakeshwar is one of the 12 jyotirlingas. It is one of most important MANDIR (Temple) of Hindu / Santana dharma. It is mandir of Bhagwan (Lord) Shiva.
This temple has no raised Pind /Linga but a depression with 3 small pinds in the depression. Water of River Godawari gets out of it from benith continuously and naturally."
"The atmosphere in the temple is serene but it's become a little like a business now, come, stand for not more than 2-3 seconds inside temple and they push you saying next next."
"One of the best shiva temple, very good ambience and positivity. Really enjoyed every moment"
Auspicious visit and devine experience. Took almost 3 hours for darshan on a holiday. Paid darshan being offered at ‚Çπ200 per person. Avoid paying any other person for darshan. Phones are allowed inside. Parking is managed by private owners and charged to their will.
Visited this temple 3 times and in 2016 I got a chance to go inside the main building(Ghrbh Graha). But now the temple is under Devsthan Trust. The ganga godavari water is also come inside shivling.
Best to visit the temple in the morning to escape the heat and the crowd. There are ample eateries and vendors surrounding the temple.
"A great temple for Hindus, however lack of online system of booking Darshan tickets, in-line with Shirdi Sansthan, which is a big discomfort to visiting devotees and pilgrims have to wait for more than 3-4 hours in Rs.200/- donation ticket ‚Ä¶"

The temple was beautiful and peaceful. I bought VIP pass for Rs. 200 per head and still had to wait for more than 3 hours in line. Do not buy flowers etc before entering the temple because nothing is allowed inside temple.  Do not park your vehicles in private parkings which is far away. There are paid parkings at Rs 50 near the temple.
Trimbakeshwar is known as Dakshin Kashi and included in 12 Jyotirlinga since ancient centuries. HOLY HINDU Temple with much positive vibes and surrounding is good for meditation. ‚Ä¶

Visited this Temple today after my 1 year of my wish.  Waited in Gendral Darshan for 1.30 hours and got Darshan. Very good spritual places of Shiva. As i lived in Chidhambaram of Tamil Nadu.  This was one of that 5 Elements of earth. Try to visit atleast once in your Life time. Om Nama Shivaya.
"One of the 12th Jyotirling.
We visited on 18.11.23, hygiene maintained.
We stand in a queue for approx 4 hrs, there is a donation Darshan of ‚Çπ200."
The only plus about the temple is the devotional feel. There is a huge crowd on weekends and the place becomes expensive. Normal queues are too lengthy and may take up to 2 to 3 hours on average to reach the main temple. There is a donation line which charges 200 INR per person.
So croweded place...It can take  three to  five hours for darshan ...Pay and darshan is available there cost is started from 200 rs...Holly place for hindu ...It's one of jyotirling into of the  twelve jyotirlunga..It's surrounded by  hills ..
