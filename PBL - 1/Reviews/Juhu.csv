Lovely place but needs more upkeep. The entry to the beach is clogged by vehicles. Don't visit on a holiday as it will be like a fish market.
This is a stunning beach. Place is crowded but beach area is large. Lots of food stalls are there. You can seat in sand for hours and enjoy the beauty of Arabian sea.

Very crowded beach. Has good street food options. One can also rent mats to sit and enjoy the sea breeze or watch the sunset.
One of the best attractions in Mumbai. Brilliant place to spend some time with loved ones and hear the pleasant susurration. My advice would be to avoid Sundays as the place is heavily crowded especially during sunset. Overall a wonderful place

I visited here on Sunday and that was my biggest mistakes. Ironically I couldn't see much of water as the view was blocked by thousands of people. Neither could feel the cool breeze. Moreover those hawkers won't allow u to be at peace. I guess if ur a beach lover head to Goa.

Advice : Have some good street food in the chaupati nearby and just enjoy the sunset view"

Hot spot in Mumbai . Beach is kept neat and gets crowded towards the evening. Parking is an issue and be careful on pickpockets and avoid unwanted attention. Some water sports options available.
How I wish to see the beach clean. But I think it‚Äôs next to impossible. Because it‚Äôs not one man‚Äôs duty to keep it clean. Every individual has to think before they spread their filthy garbage all over the beach. Sunsets and sea will always be looking beautiful but not the beach. üåÖ ‚Ä¶

Juhu Beach is awesome. It's one of the best beach in India. Once It should be visited by everyone in their lifetime.

This place is not clean. I have been to this place multiple times but only once did I tried to go near the water. And I felt disgusting by it. There was so much of polybags and so much of garbage that it was not a good experience. Food stalls here are also not very hygienic. So it's better if you avoid eating there.

"One of the most crowded beaches of Mumbai. Since this place is close to the largest suburbs of western mumbai, hence the crowd. The water here is kinda brownish. I wouldn't recommend anyone to swim here as the water here is not so clean"
Cool sea shore with long beach. Commercialized too much. Always crowded and chaotic. Although must visit for those who want to taste the chat items and experience the beach. Not good to go inside water. Most enjoyable for kids to play in shore sand.
"Beach is good place to relax and enjoy nature. Calm water and less crowded early morning. It‚Äôs best to visit in morning hours as late evening it is too crowded. People come here for morning walks or jogging. At times it‚Äôs clean and neat, ‚Ä¶"

"Awesome beach, got some very profound memories here. Both sunset and sunrise here are sight to watch. Multiple vendors alongside road will also spice up your beach experience with local vada paw and street food. Must visit for every tourist as well as local."
Overall a good way to hangout with friends or family. If anyone wants to enjoy the evening near a beach and stroll around then u can go there. But always expect huge crowd there and can't expect a calm evening. Won't suggest as a place for tourist destination but for a weekend getaway with close ones is a good option.

I rode cycle here. It's to good in early morning when less chat centres and cleanliness is there. This included with Cool Breeze gives a beautiful experience.
The beach is good place to hang out..it‚Äôs clean and less crowded. U must try the boat ride which should not cost more than 100 bucks per person. U can find some decent restaurants nearby at average. Make sure to wear a cap and water proof sandals/tong to get max fun.

The entrance was a bit crowded and dirty as hell. But towards the other side of the beach was nice and serene. The aesthetic during the sunset along with the background of people and stalls in the beach is a great ambiance for anyone to experience.
"Had a great time...:-)
It is relatively clean than other beaches I've visited. Evening time is the ideal time to go out and enjoy. If you're planning to visit here between 11 am to 5 pm do carry an umbrella like thing to sit under some shade..rest is wonderful about the place."

1) Toilets are not clean.
2) Do not have safe place to keep luggeges.

Nice beach for a morning or evening walk. A bit crowded on the weekends and holidays. The authorities should ensure that the beach is kept clean. People also should pitch in for keeping it clean.
