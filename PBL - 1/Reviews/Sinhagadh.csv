"An absolutely beautiful fort. As far as we know, Tanaji malusare won this fort by betting his life on it. Hilly areas surround the entire fort, which is surrounded by trees on all sides. The view of sunrise in the morning is worth seeing ‚Ä¶"
"Very Good place, i visited there in June month by bike from Pune, it was around 50km and took 1 hr. At the top you will get amazing, kaanda bhajji and pithla bhakri, and some other fruits, barf Gola. It was amazing."
"Best tourist place well maintained, there are two road one is for walkers & the other is for vehicle they charge 100 for 4 wheeler, 50 for 2. Road are good but have to be very careful to many blind turns"

"So nice environment and nature near fort. Actual condition of fort Is so bad but you will enjoy climbing of fort and lunch at final destination, if you able to reach üòú ‚Ä¶"
One day trip from Pune. Monsoon season best for visit. Trekking and sightseeing. Pithla bhakri and curd is famous in sinhagad
so final i visited the fort which is having a great history of Tanhaji Malusre. Although it is connected by road but you should prefer the trek if you want to feel the nature . A 1 hour trek from base to top. Fort area is very vast and you ‚Ä¶
Sinhgad Fort is a must visit place for people visiting Pune. I recommend visiting on weekdays and avoid weekends as it gets pretty crowded. Trekking will also be difficult on weekends as you would need to stop every now and then for people ‚Ä¶
"Sinhgarh (Kondhana) fort has historic importance and it was well depicted in bollywood movie Tanha Ji. I visited this place multiple times, un my recent visit I found that road conditions are improved and parking charges are collected at ‚Ä¶"

"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the historic Sinhagad Fort near Pune, and I must say, it was an incredible experience. From the moment I embarked on the journey, I was captivated by the scenic beauty that surrounded me. ‚Ä¶"
"Great experience
Amazing cloud view from the top.
It is best experience when you are there in rainy season with light rain ‚Ä¶"
We enjoyed our trip to fort. The journey to fort was nice. It needs atleast 2+ hours to explore completely. Must go visit for couples and along with friends too. üëç ‚Ä¶
"Best place to spend a day with your loved ones. Breathtaking views and in rainy season you should not miss the trip to here.
Don't forget to have Zunka Bhakri at Sinhagadh Dhaba near Parking."
"Cant explain in words how much i like it.. i will start from beginning how we reached here.. we started journey from shivaji nagar, on bikes from 6 o'clock. We  reached to top in 1 hour by bikes. ‚Ä¶"
"Best place for trekking. Leave at morning 5.30, reach at around 6.45 and feel the sun rise into the sky. Go via pune darwaza and sit around the corner of the fort and absorb the vitamin D while having the typical maharashtrian breakfast, ‚Ä¶"
"One of the best place to visit in Pune. Sinhgad Fort is the historical place. Everyone must visit this place and learn our great history also bring childrens and here teach them  History of The Great Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Tanaji ‚Ä¶"
"Good place for hiking  üòä ....Just ..Try to avoid coming on holidays...aa there is lot of traffic ..and usually takes 1-2 hrs just to travel 10 km ...
But it's worth visiting üòå ‚ò∫ ‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful . Awesome and what not . You will find peace here. Few points as an information.
1. There is a Sinhagad Authority charge of INR 50 as an entrance fee for 4 ‚Ä¶"
It is good to go there in rainy season only because at that time the place is full of greenery. And it's not actually like a fort according to the expectations. It's wall only there on the name of fort. If you are found of hilly places then it is good place for you. And the food and 'dhabas' are good over there.
"Historical place so don't drink or smoke strictly prohibited. Very good for trekking in rainy season, good for holiday. But remember this is not your picnic spot. This is Chatrapati shivaji maharaj fort. Follow rules and keep clean the fort."
